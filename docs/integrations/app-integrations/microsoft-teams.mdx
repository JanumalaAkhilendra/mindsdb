This documentation describes the integration of MindsDB with [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), the ultimate messaging app for your organization.
The integration allows MindsDB to create chat-bots enhanced with AI capabilities that can respond to messages in Microsoft Teams.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect Microsoft Teams to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).

## Connection

Establish a connection to Microsoft Teams from MindsDB by executing the following SQL command and providing its [handler name](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/main/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/ms_teams_handler) as an engine.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE teams_conn
WITH ENGINE = 'teams', 
PARAMETERS = {
  "client_id": "12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef",
  "client_secret": "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6"
};

Required connection parameters include the following:

* `client_id`: The client ID of the registered Microsoft Entra ID application.
* `client_secret`: The client secret of the registered Microsoft Entra ID application.

<Note>
Microsoft Entra ID was previously known as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
</Note>

Follow the instructions given below to set up the Microsoft Teams app that will act as the chatbot:

  1. Follow [this link](https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new) to the Microsoft Bot Framework portal and sign in with your Microsoft account.
  2. Fill out the required fields, but leave the messaging endpoint empty for now.
  3. Click on *Create Microsoft App ID and password*. This will open a new tab with the Azure portal.
  4. Click on *New registration* and fill out the *Name* and *Supported account types* fields, and click on *Register*. Record the *Application (client) ID* for later use.
  5. Click on *Certificates & secrets* under *Manage*.
  6. Click on *New client secret* and fill out the required fields and click on *Add*.
  7. Copy the client secret and save it in a secure location.
  <Tip>
  If you already have an existing app registration, you can use it instead of creating a new one and skip steps 4-6.
  </Tip>

  8. Open the MindsDB Editor and create a connection to Microsoft Teams using the client ID and client secret obtained in the previous steps using the SQL command provided above.
  9. Using this connection, create a chatbot using the [`CREATE CHATBOT`](/agents/chatbot) syntax.
  10. Run the `SHOW CHATBOTS` command and record the `webhook_token` of the chatbot you created.
  11. Navigate back to the Microsoft Bot Framework portal and fill out the messaging endpoint in the following format: `<mindsdb_url>/api/chatbots/webhooks/<webhook_token>`.
  <Tip>
  The `<mindsdb_url>` is the URL of where MindsDB is running.
  Please note that if you are running MindsDB locally, it will need to be exposed to the internet using a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
  </Tip>

  12. Fill out the *Microsoft App ID* using the client ID obtained in the previous steps and click on *Register*.
  13. Under *More channels*, click on *Microsoft Teams*.
  14. Navigate to Microsoft Teams and navigate to *Apps*.
  15. Search for the *Developer Portal* app and add it to your workspace.
  16. Open the *Developer Portal*, click on *Apps* and then on *New app*.
  17. Fill out the *Name* for the app and click on *Add*.
  18. Navigate to *App features* and select *Bot*.
  19. Choose the *Select an existing bot* option and select the bot you created earlier in the Microsoft Bot Framework portal.
  20. Select all of the scopes where bot is required to be used and click on *Save*.
  21. Finally, on the navigation pane, click on *Publish* and then on *Publish to your org*.

To start using the chatbot, you will need to ask your IT administrator to approve the submission at this [link](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps). 

Once it is approved, users can find it under the *Built for your org* section in the *Apps* tab. They can either chat with the bot directly or add it to a channel. To chat with the bot in a channel, type `@<bot_name>` followed by your message.

While waiting for approval, you can test the chatbot by clicking on *Preview in Teams* in the Developer Portal.
